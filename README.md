# SF Testing Formula Generator
This script takes a user persona input ('PE' or 'PM') along with the tab_names.csv file (A csv with rows of google sheet tab names) and generates a Google Sheets Formula to populate a google sheet tab with other tabs based on the PERSONA supplied by the user and PERSONA defined in the testing tabs.
